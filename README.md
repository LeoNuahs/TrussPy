# TrussPy - Determinant Truss Solver
A Python CLI application I made during September 2023 to solve for the determinants of a 2D truss as I was listening to my friend rant in his 2nd year of Civil Engineering. He challenged me to write this without using the more powerful libraries. Hence, the creation of this using `numpy` and `pandas` only.
